### System Workflow
1. Invoice Registration
2. Tokenization Process
3. Credit Score Calculation
4. Smart Contract Execution
5. Payment Settlement
6. Transaction Verification

## Smart Contract Modules

### Key Contracts
- `InvoiceToken.sol`: Invoice tokenization
- `PaymentEscrow.sol`: Automated payment handling
- `CreditScoreOracle.sol`: Performance evaluation
- `ComplianceRegistry.sol`: Regulatory adherence
- `BankingIntegration.sol`: Fiat interface

### Invoice Data Model
```javascript
struct Invoice {
  id: string;
  supplier: address;
  buyer: address;
  amount: uint256;
  dueDate: uint256;
  status: InvoiceStatus;
  tokenizationTimestamp: uint256;
  performanceMetrics: {
    deliverySpeed: uint8;
    qualityScore: uint8;
    paymentHistory: uint8;
  }
}

enum InvoiceStatus {
  PENDING,
  VERIFIED,
  FUNDED,
  SETTLED,
  DEFAULTED
}
```
